# Description
This project is a data warehousing solution designed to source, store, and model data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository about rental bikes introduced in urban cities. It aims to provide a centralized repository for analyzing and visualizing hourly bike counts based on hours of the day, temperature, rainfall, etc. 

# Business Impacts

## Business Problem
Rental bikes have been introduced to urban cities to improve mobility and comfort. Many citizens will rely on these rental bikes, therefore ensuring their availability and accessibility to the public at the right times. A large concern of the cities implementing these bikes is predicting the number of bikes needed each hour to maintain a stable supply and reduce wait times. 

## Business Persona
The results of this model will interest the government of Seoul, Community Organizers, and Residents.

## Requirements
There must be a model built to predict the demand for rental bikes at different times of the day. This will help in optimizing bike distribution and ensuring a stable supply to meet the expected demand at all times. 

# Data
This dataset is provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes weather data (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), hourly bike rental numbers, and date information.
